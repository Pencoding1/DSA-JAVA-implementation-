# DSA JAVA implementation 
 This is for learning DSA at school, also a note for me in the future or everyone who want to learn DSA.
 The repo will be divided by two part. The first part is DSA when I self-taught and the second is DSA when I learn from school.
 The reason I choose this setup because in my school the program kinda weird. It may or may not include some information. Therefore I want to make sure I don't miss any pieces of knowledge of DSA because I know it is ver important to a IT student and a developer. 
 # GOALS:
 ## A note for me in future to review, and if it possible, for people who want to learn DSA accidentally see my repo.
 The implementation must be clear and possible for human beings understand. If the concept is too complicate the code must contains explaination for the concept.
 ## Improving Java Skills.
 The second goal is by doing this note I want to improve my Java skill. Therefore, I would use any technique Java has (if I know it). Also the implementation also contains OOP. Because Java doesn't really have pointer so I think concepts that contain pointer-implementation would be in another file which I use C++.
 I also using my most familiar language, Python, to double check by that I can make sure my implementations are not wrong.
 ## Seeking the support from community
 Last but not least, even I quiet confident in my skill but I'm not perfect so I need you, a random guy accidentally see my repo, to teach me what I did wrong. I will be very appriciated with any comment on my implementation, by that hope you feel free to complain or even make a request on my repo. I will check it when I see the notification and reply you after that.
 # The Main Concept:
 ## 1.Waiting for the Update (I think it will be some technique when solve the problem. Maybe Big O and Control Flow as for, while, etc)
